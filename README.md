<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many HTML&CSS tutorials available on YouTube, however, not all of them are intended for beginners and show the basics. This project is a part of HYF studies and it was offered as a part of the curriculum. So I created this project as a personal practice and a reference for the others and a part of homework check process.

Here's why:
* you should be able to visualise the work that has been done and the result by a simple click on the link
* you should be able to reference this project as a template with clean, nice and simple source code and documentation
* you should try DIY principles by contributing yourself to the current project or use it as a source of your inspiration :smile:

Apparently, nor project example or template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I might try some more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue or leaving a comment.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
